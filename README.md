For the first time when we are starting the host machine to lauch the
website on a local network, we have to ensure that the database tables
are created.Also, We are required to create an admin for the website.

Run the following commands in the bash shell for creating an admin as well as databases:

$$$ python3 create_admin.py

For running the app, just run the app.py file

NOTE: Make sure that all the environment variable are listed in the .env file and 
      run "source .env" on the bash shell to ensure all the environment variable are
      defined.
